Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has elevated expression in over 90% of cancers. The key role of TERT is as the catalytic protein subunit of the telomerase complex. Increasing expression of telomerase works against constant telomere erosion by increasing telomere length and allows a tumor cell to evade senescence and apoptosis. Variation within TERT has been linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) development, and differences in CRC prognosis. In this thesis, we examine whether single nucleotide changes along the TERT gene have any relation to all-cause mortality after CRC diagnosis. Additionally, due to the differences in molecular patterns in cancers of the ascending and descending colon, relevant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) expression might vary based on the location of the primary tumor within the bowel. As a second aim, we examine whether the location of the tumor (ascending/ descending colon) influences TERT SNP survival associations. Finally, we examine if changes in the TERT gene influence telomere length. We found limited support that TERT SNPs may have an association with CRC survival. Similarly, we found no association between any TERT SNPs and overall or CRC-specific survival from CRC diagnosed in any region of the colon. There is some support for the hypothesis that TERT SNPs have an association with telomere length, though this is known to be polygenic.
